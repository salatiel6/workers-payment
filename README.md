## Exercise

The company ACME offers their employees the flexibility to work the hours they want. They will pay for the hours worked based on the day of the week and time of day, according to the following table:

Monday - Friday  
`00:01 - 09:00 25 USD`  
`09:01 - 18:00 15 USD`  
`18:01 - 00:00 20 USD`  

Saturday and Sunday  
`00:01 - 09:00 30 USD`  
`09:01 - 18:00 20 USD`  
`18:01 - 00:00 25 USD`  

The goal of this exercise is to calculate the total that the company has to pay an employee, based on the hours they worked and the times during which they worked. The following abbreviations will be used for entering data:

**MO**: Monday  
**TU**: Tuesday  
**WE**: Wednesday  
**TH**: Thursday  
**FR**: Friday  
**SA**: Saturday  
**SU**: Sunday  

**Input**: The name of an employee and the schedule they worked, indicating the time and hours. This should be a .txt file with at least five sets of data. You can include the data from our two examples below.

**Output**: indicate how much the employee has to be paid

For example:

Case 1:
```
INPUT:
RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00

OUTPUT:
The amount to pay RENE is: 215 USD
```


Case 2:
```
INPUT:
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

OUTPUT:
The amount to pay ASTRID is: 85 USD
```

## Solution Tree
### The `main.py` module:
The running process occurs in `main.py`. Module responsible for making every method of `Employee` class work.  
Its main function is `payment()`, which receives `worked_schedules.txt` by default as a param.
But you can create another file and pass it when calling the method.  

The first thing the function do, is to check if the param file exists:
```
if not os.path.isfile(file):
    raise FileError()
```
If not, a custom error is raised `FileError`, explainig what happened, and what should be done:
```
The employee schedule file was not found.
Please attach your file in the root of the project
By default, the file should be called 'worked_schedules.txt'. But you can use another name.
Just remember to put your custom file name in the params of payment() function
```
After validating that the file exists, the function read its content, allocating every line inside `worked_schedules` list:
```
f = open(file, "r")
    worked_schedules = f.readlines()
    f.close()
```

Then, for every line, we create an instance of the `Employee` class:
```
for worked_schedule in worked_schedules:
    employee = Employee(worked_schedule.rstrip())
```
> *Obs**: The `Employee` class, can be called just passing the schedule string in the right format:
> ```
> >>> from ioet_challenge.src.employee import Employee
> >>> worker_schedule = "ROBERT=MO06:00-12:00,WE11:00-15:00,TH01:00-03:00,FR15:00-18:00,SA19:00-21:00"
> >>> employee = Employee(worker_schedule)
> ```
> And then you can check every detail:
> ```
> >>> employee.name
> 'ROBERT'
>     
> >>> employee.worked_time
> ['MO06:00-12:00', 'WE11:00-15:00', 'TH01:00-03:00', 'FR15:00-18:00', 'SA19:00-21:00']
>     
> >>> employee.payment_amount
> 325
> ```

Finishing, we print the `employee__str__`, which contains the name, and the amount for the employee:
```
print(employee)
```
---
### The `employee.py` module
It's the module that contains the Employee class, which its methods make all the necessary validations and processes for 
calculating the payment amount.  

Its `__init__` method receives the `worked_schedule` variable, which must contain a line of `worked_schedules.txt`. This line must be a string
in the default format, e.g: `"JOHN=FR02:00-03:00,SA17:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00"`.  
As we can see, the name, and the worked time of an employee, is on the file. So the variables `name` and `worked_time` are initiated as empty strings.  
After that, the method `get_employee_data()` will be responsable for bringing value to these variables.
```
def __init__(self, worked_schedule: str):
    self.name = ""
    self.worked_time = ""
    self.worked_schedule = worked_schedule
    self.get_employee_data()
    self.payment_amount = self.calculate_payment_amount()
```
---
The `get_emplyoee_data` at first it calls `validate_schedule()` method, which checks if the string is on the pattern format.

```
def get_employee_data(self):
    if not self.validate_schedule():
        raise FilePatternError()
```
> The `validate_schedule` method uses a regular expression to validate if the input is on the right pattern
> ```
> def validate_schedule(self) -> bool:
>      rgx = "^(?:[A-Z]+)=(?:(?:MO|TU|WE|TH|FR|SA|SU)" \
>            "(?:0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]-(?:0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):" \
>            "[0-5][0-9](?:,|))+"
> ```
> Regex explanation:  
> **1.** (name) - `^(?:[A-Z]+)=`: The string must start with one or more ocurrences of upper case letters, and then has a '=' sign  
> **2.** (day of week) - `(?:MO|TU|WE|TH|FR|SA|SU)`: After the '=' the string must continue with one of the seven initials of the week  
> **3.** (entering hour) - `(?:0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]-`: Validates if the hour and minute is valid within the 24hrs format, then it must have a '-' sign  
> **4.** (exiting hour) - `(?:0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]`: The same as above, but not containig '-'  
> **5.** (end of statement) - `(?:,|)`: After the enterign and exiting times, the string must have a ',' if there's another one after. Or must finish without any symbol  
> `(?:)+`: Encapsulates parts from 2 to 5, telling that it must have one or more ocurrences  
> 
> After that we use `re.findall()` to discover if the expression is valid. If it is we return `True`, if not, `False`:
>```
>  if not re.findall(rgx, self.worked_schedule) or \
>          re.findall(rgx, self.worked_schedule)[0] != \
>          self.worked_schedule:
>      return False
>
>  return True
> ```
If the input is not valid, a custom error is raised `FilePatternError`, explainig what happened, and what should be done:
```
The employee schedule file is out of the pattern.
Please review your file content
```
With everythin valid, lets split the string in two parts, through `=` signal.  
`worker_name` receives the name at index 0  
`worker_schedule` receives the rest of the string containing the days and times worked:
```
worker_name = self.worked_schedule.split("=")[0]
worker_schedule = self.worked_schedule.split("=")[1]
```
For `worker_schedule` we create a list called `worked_time` spliting the times by `,` signal
```
worked_time = [worked for worked in worker_schedule.split(",")]
```
After all we set the name and the working time in them respective variables:
```
self.name = worker_name
self.worked_time = worked_time
```

With `worker_name` and `worked_time` set, we still need to set the employee payment amount, and what does it, is the `calculate_payment_amount()`
```
self.payment_amount = self.calculate_payment_amount()
```
---
The `calculate_payment_amount()` is the main method for getting the right values within time and day worked.  
At first, we define the amount as 0.  
And then, for every registry at `worked_time` list, we pick three variables:
```
def calculate_payment_amount(self) -> int:
    amount = 0
    for day_n_hour in self.worked_time:
        day = day_n_hour[0:2]
        str_entering = day_n_hour[2:].split("-")[0]
        str_exiting = day_n_hour[2:].split("-")[1]
```
Let's use this registry as example: `WE06:00-12:00`  
So we'll have:  
`day`: `WE`  
`str_entering`: `06:00`  
`str_exiting`: `12:00`

Then, we convert `str_entering` and `str_exiting` to datetime, and start a counter variable with the same value as `entering`
```
entering = datetime.strptime(str_entering, "%H:%M")
exiting = datetime.strptime(str_exiting, "%H:%M")

time_counter = entering
```

So, now we can star our calculation telling that, while our counter is between `entering` and `exiting` times, we're going to
count one more hour, get this hour period, and then sum the amount based on the day and the period worked .  
The period is got by `get_period()` method.  
The amount is got by `get_hour_payment()` method.
```
while entering <= time_counter < exiting:
    time_counter += timedelta(hours=1)
    period = self.get_period(time_counter)
    amount += self.get_hour_payment(day, period)
```
---
The `get_period()` method is a static method, which recieves the hour worked and evaluates which period this is part.  
We have three periods:  
`P1`: From `00:01` to `09:00`  
`P2`: From `09:01` to `18:00`  
`P3`: From `18:01` to `00:00`  
These periods are allocated in a constant dictionary present in `constants.py` module

**Obs:** Note that, when validating `P3`, we need to check if the time is **greater** or equal than the exiting time. Because on `P3`, exiting
time is `00:00`, and `datetime` interprets `00:00` as the lowest time value.
```
@staticmethod
def get_period(time) -> str:
    if PERIODS["P1"]["entering"] <= time <= PERIODS["P1"]["exiting"]:
        return "P1"
    if PERIODS["P2"]["entering"] <= time <= PERIODS["P2"]["exiting"]:
        return "P2"
    if PERIODS["P3"]["entering"] <= time >= PERIODS["P3"]["exiting"]:
        return "P3"
```
PERIODS dictionary at contants.py
```
PERIODS = {
    "P1": {
        "entering": datetime.strptime("00:01", "%H:%M"),
        "exiting": datetime.strptime("09:00", "%H:%M")
    },
    "P2": {
        "entering": datetime.strptime("09:01", "%H:%M"),
        "exiting": datetime.strptime("18:00", "%H:%M")
    },
    "P3": {
        "entering": datetime.strptime("18:01", "%H:%M"),
        "exiting": datetime.strptime("00:00", "%H:%M")
    }
}
```

---
The `get_hour_payment()` method is also static. It receives the day worked and the period got by the method above.  
With these two information, first we see if the day is of a week or weekend.  
And then we get the amount value by a constant dictionary present in `constants.py`
```
@staticmethod
def get_hour_payment(day, period) -> int:
    if day in WEEK_DAYS:
        return HOUR_PAYMENT_VALUES["week"][period]
    if day in WEEKEND_DAYS:
        return HOUR_PAYMENT_VALUES["weekend"][period]
```
Constants used by this method at `constants.py`  
```
WEEK_DAYS = ["MO", "TU", "WE", "TH", "FR"]
WEEKEND_DAYS = ["SA", "SU"]
HOUR_PAYMENT_VALUES = {
    "week": {
        "P1": 25,
        "P2": 15,
        "P3": 20
    },
    "weekend": {
        "P1": 30,
        "P2": 20,
        "P3": 25
    }
}
```
Finishing, the `Employee` class also contains a `__str__` method, which describes the payment amount:
```
def __str__(self):
    return f"The amount to pay {self.name} is: " \
           f"{self.payment_amount} USD"
```
